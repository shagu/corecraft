sql-compact takes a mysql dump created with --skip-extended-inserts and compacts
it into a single insert query while still keeping the data split over multiple
lines for easier revisioning in git.

Compile:
    go build sql-compact.go

Usage:
    mysqldump --skip-extended-insert database | ./sql-compact > database.sql
