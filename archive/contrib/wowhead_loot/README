The purpose of this tool is to give it a list of item IDs and have it query
wowhead.com for you, and look at the "Dropped By" tab and extract the
information needed to build INSERT queries into mango's creature_loot_template
database.

How to use:
1. Create a file called "input" and fill it with an item id per line, for
example (the file needs to be in the same directory as the .py script):
2589
2592
4306

2. Launch the script and wait for it to finish, like such:
python wowhead_loot.py

What the output is:
There will be 3 files created (query.sql, warnings, failed), the files contain:
query.sql: an sql file you can run to insert the data into mangos' world DB
failed:    a file with the same structure as input, listing all item ids that
           had no Dropped By column
warnings:  a file with warnings, listing line numbers in query.sql as well as
           what looks odd with that specific query. warnings should be manually
           looked at before query.sql is imported into the database

           
Tested with python 2.7.3.
