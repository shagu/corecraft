INSTALL
    Setup the following dependencies:
        Detours Express 3.0:
            http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/detours/
        DirectX SDK for 9.0c:
            http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812

    Run the Visual Studio Command Prompt and run the following commands to
    compile the program:
    
    cl /EHsc wfd.cpp /I <DirectX Include Dir> /I <Detours Include Dir> /I <zlib Include Dir>
        
        Example:
        cl /c /EHsc wfd.cpp /I "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Research\Detours Express 3.0\include" /I "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)\Include" /I "C:\Program Files (x86)\zlib"
    
    link wfd.obj user32.lib d3d9.lib detours.lib zlib.lib /LIBPATH:<DirectX Libs> /LIBPATH:<Detours Libs> /LIBPATH:<zlib lib> /DLL /OUT:wfd.dll
    
        Example:
        link wfd.obj user32.lib d3d9.lib detours.lib zlib.lib /LIBPATH:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)\Lib\x86" /LIBPATH:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Research\Detours Express 3.0\lib.X86" /LIBPATH:"C:\Program Files (x86)\zlib\x86" /DLL /OUT:wfd.dll

USAGE
    To use the program you just load the wfd.dll into the target WoW process,
    and output will be printed to "wdf.out". Search for the string "FREEZE"
    after a freeze happens and you will see what data was received up until
    that point.
    
    As for the DLL injection tool anything goes. A simplistic tool that does
    nothing but CreateRemoteThread to call LoadLibrary from the target WoW
    process is all you need. A quick google came up with the following tool that
    can do that: https://github.com/OpenSecurityResearch/dllinjector
